This challenge was challenging.

Task: Create an interactive dashboord to explore Belly Button Diversity.  This required me to:
1. Import the samples.json data >> data
2. Populate the Test Subject ID No: with the IDs >> data.names
3. Create an on change event listener to:
    a. Listen for a change in the dropdown value
    b. Build the following charts for the selected ID:
        1. Demographic Info (panel)
        2. Top 10 OTU IDs (bar chart)
        3. Top 10 OTU IDs by Percentage (pie chart)
        4. Wash Frequency (gauge)
        5. Sample Values by OTU ID (bubble chart)
